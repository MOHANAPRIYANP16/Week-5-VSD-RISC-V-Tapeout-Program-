## Objectives:

- Set up the **OpenROAD Flow Scripts** environment for physical design automation.

- Execute the **Floorplan** and **Placement** stages of the backend implementation flow.

- Transition from **SPICE-level transistor design (Week 4)** to the **physical layout** stage.

- Understand how synthesized logic is transformed into an **actual chip layout** using EDA tools.
